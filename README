Quick Instructions
==================

In order to build Beam.JS, make sure you have g++, erlang & scons installed system-wide. Then just type:

	$ make

After a couple of minutes (V8 takes quite some time to build), it should be over. In order to start using Beam.JS REPL, just type:

        $ ./beamjs

Good luck!
